# English-Language-Learning

Project designed to asses the language proficiency of English Language Learners (ELLs). The dataset provided will be a collection of essays written by ELLs. The essays will first be analyzed using a variety of NLP techniques to determine the proficiency level of the ELLs. The essays will then be used to train a machine learning model that will be able to predict the proficiency level of an ELL based on their essay. The model will be tested on a separate set of essays to determine its accuracy.

In addition to the machine learning model, we will prepare the data to be efficient for production use, by creating a REST API that will allow the model to be used in a web application. The web application will allow users to input an essay and receive a proficiency level prediction.
