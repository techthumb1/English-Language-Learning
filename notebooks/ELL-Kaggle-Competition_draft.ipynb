Just download the following 3 things (1) model weights, (2) tokenizer files, (3) config file, and upload them to a Kaggle dataset. Below shows code how to get the files from HuggingFace for AllenAI's model longformer-base. But this same code can download any transformer, like for example roberta-base.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then just upload all these files to a Kaggle dataset, like what I did here. Then you load them into your notebook like the notebook you are reading. And we can turn internet off!"
